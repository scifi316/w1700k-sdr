"""Return an installed unit to its stock operating state from its backup.

    1. stop stock U-Boot and boot the restorer from RAM through it, as the
       installer boots the dumper, so a unit whose installed loader no longer
       starts is restored all the same
    2. (the restorer lifts the switch's rate limit; it then receives at ~20 MiB/s)
    3. check that the unit is the backup's
    4. send the backup gzip-compressed, unpack it into RAM and check that RAM
       holds the backup exactly (its SHA-256)
    5. check that the vendor partitions nothing here writes (`bootloader`,
       `calibration`) already hold the backup's bytes
    6. on the device, compare every block of stock's images, then of stock's
       environment (`uenv`, last, so an interrupted run still boots our loader),
       with RAM, and erase, write and read back only the blocks that differ,
       through the vendor BBT/BMT with the chip's ECC on (`nandsync`)
    7. compare everything written once more: no block may differ
    8. reset, and watch stock U-Boot start stock's kernel

The backup is the vendor-logical data the dumper read (backup.py), so this puts
back every byte stock firmware reads. The chip's own state (bad blocks, the
reserve pool) stays as the vendor tables describe it now. Nothing is read back
to the host, and NAND blocks that already hold the backup are not rewritten.
